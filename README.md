# Analysis of Linear System Solvers

This project explores different methods for solving linear systems of equations, with a focus on **LU decomposition** and **matrix inversion**.  

We compare the accuracy of these methods by evaluating:
- Errors under different matrix norms  
- Varying matrix sizes  
- Different condition numbers  

## Objectives
- Understand the behavior of LU decomposition vs. matrix inversion.  
- Analyze how numerical errors grow with matrix size and conditioning.  
- Gain insights into the stability and reliability of each method.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
